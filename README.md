    ```python
    # Use the provided 'site-packages' directory
    # site_packages_dir = r'D:\XXXXX\XXXXX\venv\Lib\site-packages'
    
    site_packages_dir = r'YOUR_PACKAGE_PATH'
    ```

2. **Run the Script**: Execute the script in your Python environment. This will generate an Excel file with all the installed packages sorted by installation date.

3. **Check the Output**: The Excel file will be saved in the same directory as the script:
    ```plaintext
    D:\XXXXX\XXXXXX\installed_packages_with_uninstall_values.xlsx
    ```
